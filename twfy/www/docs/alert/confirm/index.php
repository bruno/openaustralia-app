// Name: /alert/confirm/index.php
// Author:  Richard Allan richard@sheffieldhallam.org.uk
// Version: 0.5 beta
// Date: 6th Jan 2005
// Description:  This file contains ALERT class.

// This the page users come to when they click the link in their
// confirmation email after joining the site.

// What happens? They will come here with t=23-adsf7897fd78d9sfsd200501021500
// where the value of 't' is a form of their registration token.
// This token is a salted version of their email address concatenated
// with the time the alert was created.

// We check this exists in the database and if so we run the confirm
// function of class ALERT to set the field confirmed in the table
// alerts to true.

// We then print a nice welcome message.

// This depends on there being page definitions in metadata.php

// FUNCTIONS
// confirm_success()		Displays a page with a success confirmation message
// confirm_error()		Displays a page with an error message
