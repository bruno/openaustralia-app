       To move the following Clause:--

        `(1)  A Minister of the Crown may by order under this section make any provision which

         (4)  Provision may not be made under subsection (1) in relation to any burden which
              affects only a Minister of the Crown or government department, unless it affects
              the Minister or department in the exercise of a regulatory function.

         (5)  For the purposes of subsection (2), a financial cost or administrative inconvenience
              may result from the form of any legislation (for example, where the legislation is
              hard to understand).

         (6)  In this section "legislation" means any of the following or a provision of any of the
              following--
                 (a)   a public general Act or local Act (whether passed before or after the
                       commencement of this section), or
                 (b)   any Order in Council, order, rules, regulations, scheme, warrant, byelaw or
                       other subordinate instrument made at any time under an Act referred to in
                       paragraph (a),

              but does not include any instrument which is, or is made under, Northern Ireland
              legislation.

         (7)  Subject to this Part, the provision that may be made under subsection (1)
              includes--
                (a)    provision conferring functions on any person (including functions of
                       legislating or functions relating to the charging of fees),
                (b)    provision modifying the functions conferred on any person by any
                       enactment,
                (c)    provision transferring, or providing for the transfer or delegation of, the
                       functions conferred on any person by any enactment,
                (d)    provision abolishing a body or office established by or under an enactment,
              and provision made by amending or repealing any enactment.

         (8)  An order under this section may contain such consequential, supplementary,
              incidental or transitional provision (including provision made by amending or
              repealing any enactment or other provision) as the Minister making it considers
              appropriate.

         (9)  An order under this section may bind the Crown.

       (10)   An order under this section must be made in accordance with this Part.'
